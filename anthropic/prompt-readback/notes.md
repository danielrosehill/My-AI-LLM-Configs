# Prompt readback

The purpose of this configuration is to get the model to summarize the prompt before continuing onto its output. 

This structure can be useful if you are inventorizing single prompt output pairs into a database system and wish to make sure that the model produces them in a consistent manner for programmatically separating prompts and outputs later.
